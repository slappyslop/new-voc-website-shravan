				<h3>ASSUMPTION OF RISKS</h3>
				<p>
					I am aware that participation in Outdoor Activities involves many risks, dangers and hazards. The terrain used for Outdoor Activities 
					is uncontrolled, unmarked, not inspected, and involves many risks, dangers and hazards. Avalanches occur frequently in the terrain 
					used for Outdoor Activities and may be caused by natural forces or by persons travelling through the terrain. I am aware that the 
					Releasees may fail to predict whether the terrain is safe, and whether avalanche hazards or other dangers or risks may occur. 
					Risks, dangers and hazards may include but are not limited to: rockfall, icefall, avalanches of snow, ice and rock triggered by natural 
					forces, by persons travelling through the terrain or other causes; extreme variation in terrain, including hidden or exposed rocks, 
					boulders, ice, logs, stumps, roots, forest deadfall, treewells, trees and other objects; falling trees; forest fires; concealed or exposed 
					crevasses, icebridges or bergschrunds; cornices and cornice falls; cliffs; variable and difficult snow or ice conditions, including 
					unstable snow packs or ice; ungroomed, unmarked and uncontrolled terrain; exposed or concealed holes or depressions on or 
					below the surface or ground cover; still and moving water; lakes, streams, creeks and rivers, including crossings; cold water
					immersion; entrapment by trees, logs, rocks or equipment; drowning; limited visibility; variable, severe or rapidly changing weather 
					with little or no warning including storms, high winds and lightning; dangerous and unpredictable water conditions, including waves, 
					currents, rapids, white water and waterfalls; hypothermia; hyperthermia; frostbite; loss of balance or control and falls, particularly on 
					steep, slippery or difficult terrain; difficulty or inability to control one's speed and direction; errors of judgment; lack of preparation; 
					inadequate, inappropriate, improperly prepared or adjusted equipment; equipment failure, malfunction or loss; loss or damage to 
					personal property; failure to act safely or within one's ability or within a designated area; impact or collision with vehicles, other 
					persons or objects; encounters with domestic or wild animals; becoming lost, going off route or becoming separated from one's 
					party; remote locations with unreliable, delayed or no communication and inability to get rescue or medical assistance quickly or 
					easily; dangerous driving conditions and travel over poor roads; negligence of other persons; and, <b>NEGLIGENCE ON THE PART
